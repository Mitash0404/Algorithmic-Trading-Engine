# Quick GitHub Upload Guide

## Option 1: Automated Script (Easiest)

I've created an automated script that will handle everything for you:

```bash
# Run the automated script
./upload_to_github.sh
```

This script will:
- âœ… Initialize git repository
- âœ… Add all files
- âœ… Create commit
- âœ… Create GitHub repository (if GitHub CLI is installed)
- âœ… Push to GitHub
- âœ… Verify upload

## Option 2: Manual Steps (If script doesn't work)

### Step 1: Install GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# On macOS
brew install gh

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login
```

### Step 2: Run These Commands
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/mitashshah/Documents/Projects/algorithmic_trading_engine

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Algorithmic Trading Engine

- High-performance trading engine with C++ extensions
- Multi-strategy support (cointegration, mean reversion)
- Real-time market data processing
- Comprehensive risk management
- Interactive Brokers integration
- Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning
- Backtesting framework
- Performance analytics and reporting"

# Create GitHub repository and push
gh repo create algorithmic_trading_engine --public --description "A high-performance algorithmic trading engine with real-time market data processing, multi-strategy support, and comprehensive risk management" --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

### Step 3: Verify
Visit: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/algorithmic_trading_engine

## Option 3: Web Browser Method

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `algorithmic_trading_engine`
3. Description: `A high-performance algorithmic trading engine with real-time market data processing, multi-strategy support, and comprehensive risk management`
4. Make it **Public**
5. **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"
7. Run these commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/algorithmic_trading_engine.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get authentication errors:
```bash
# Use personal access token instead of password
git config --global credential.helper store
# Enter your GitHub username and personal access token when prompted
```

## What You'll Get

Your repository will be live at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/algorithmic_trading_engine`

With a professional README, proper structure, and all your code ready for others to see and contribute to!
